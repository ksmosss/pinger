# pinger
 The program allows you to ping already prepared servers, which allows you not to show the IP address of the servers to third-party people.
 
### Compilation
To launch pinger, just open the pinger file.jar in the /out directory. You must have java JRE installed at least version 18.

### How will it be useful?
The program can be transferred to clients/partners or other third-party people without giving out the IP addresses of the servers.
